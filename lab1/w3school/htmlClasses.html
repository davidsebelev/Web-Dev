    <!-- Multiple Classes
HTML elements can belong to more than one class.

To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space, e.g. <div class="city main">. The element will be styled according to all the classes specified.

In the following example, the first <h2> element belongs to both the city class and also to the main class, and will get the CSS styles from both of the classes:  -->

Example
<h2 class="city main">London</h2>
<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>
