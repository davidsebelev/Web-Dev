// if the first operand is string , the whole operation will be treated as string 
// otherwise it will be treated as number 

//unary + , if we use him with strings operands in the result it will return int type, with number nothing changes

//if we would like to use var after incremeting/decrimenting it use ++var or --var
//but if you dont want this -> use var-- // var++

//also inc/dec having more precendence that arithmetic operations


// comma operator -> , if you use this , you can throw away the first operations , for ex:
// alert(3+5, 3+4) -> result will be 7
